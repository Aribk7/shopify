00:00-00:04: Medical examiner in Pennsylvania went rogue. Posted his findings on LinkedIn before getting fired
00:05-00:09: In 83% of autopsies where cause of death is stroke or cardiac arrest,
00:09-00:14: pharmaceutical concentrations in tissue are 8 to 40 times higher than blood levels
00:14-00:15: The drugs don't metabolize
00:15-00:16: They store
00:16-00:18: Account deleted 6 hours
00:18-00:19: I have the screenshots
00:19-00:20: Screenshot everything now
00:20-00:24: Because truth has a shelf life about six hours before someone deletes it
00:24-00:27: That medical examiners name was Dr Robert Chen
00:27-00:29: Work at Philadelphia for 14 years
00:29-00:31: performed over 2,400 autopsies.
00:31-00:33: Then he posted what he saw and lost everything
00:33-00:35: His LinkedIn post said medications
00:35-00:37: especially blood pressure medications
00:38-00:40: don't leave your body the way doctors think they do
00:40-00:42: Your blood shows one level but your tissues
00:42-00:44: 8 to 40 times higher
00:44-00:46: They accumulate layer upon layer
00:46-00:47: year after year
00:47-00:49: like sediment in a riverbed that never gets cleared
00:49-00:50: Your heart muscle
00:50-00:51: you kidney tissue
00:51-00:52: you arterial walls
00:52-00:56: all storing medications at concentrations nobody's monitoring
00:56-00:57: And when die of stroke or heart attack
00:57-01:02: They find the medication that was supposed to prevent it stored at toxic levels in the exact organs
01:02-01:04: It destroyed I read that post at 2 a.m
01:04-01:08: Screenshotted sent into myself three different ways by 8 am his account was deleted
01:08-01:12: By noon he fired,by evening every trace of Dr
01:12-01:14: Robert Chen online with scrub but
01:14-01:19: But kept digging found this personal blog deleted years ago archive version still existed one posts from
01:19-01:21: 2019 said met an Amish pathologist
01:21-01:26: at a conference, we compared notes. His community's autopsy findings show zero
01:26-01:30: pharmaceutical accumulation." I asked why? He said,"We don't take what stores
01:30-01:33: we take what flows through". That phrase haunted me-what flows through!
01:33-01:36: i spent two weeks finding Amish communities in Pennsylvania
01:36-01:38: Asked everyone the same question
01:38-01:40: What do you take for blood pressure that doesn´t store
01:40-01:42: Farm after farm same answer
01:42-01:43: Ag'd garlic extract
01:43-01:45: But not the supplement alkyne
01:45-01:47: The kind aged for 730 days
01:47-01:50: This sulfur compounds transform into S allocysteine
01:50-01:54: a compound that reduces blood pressure by restoring vessel flexibility. And it doesn't
02:20-02:24: No medications in my system, nothing storing in my tissues.
02:24-02:25: Just restoration."
02:25-02:30: Dr Chen was right the medications don't leave they layer and eventually the layers kill you
02:30-02:33: L-Array one soft gel 730 days of aging
02:33-02:35: The compound that flows through instead
02:35-02:37: Of storing up get it now because
02:37-02:39: Tthe pharmaceutical accumulation happening
02:39-02:41: In your tissues right now doesn´t show
02:41-02:42: Up on blood tests
02:42-02:42: It shows
02:42-02:44: On autopsy reports
02:44-02:44: And by then
02:44-02:46: Its too late to change anything
02:46-02:48: Doctor Chen lost his career telling
02:48-02:50: the truth, don't lose your life ignoring it.
