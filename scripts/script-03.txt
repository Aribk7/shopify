00:00-00:03: Doctors can see into your vascular future with just a single drop of blood.
00:03-00:05: In Japan, researchers thought
00:05-00:07: A 20-year old frozen blood sample from
00:07-00:09: patient who felt perfectly healthy at the time
00:09-00:12: With today's technology they found microscopic warning signals
00:13-00:16: Clear predictors that fatal blood clot would strike at 61
00:16-00:19: The man medical tests and checkups never picked it up
00:19-00:20: But in his frozen blood
00:20-00:22: Silent risk was screaming to be found
00:22-00:24: Decades before anyone saw it coming
00:24-00:26: Now those Japanese clinics use these rare
00:26-00:31: markers to warn patients, sometimes years before disaster could strike and give
00:31-00:35: folks the chance to change their fate. In the U S almost nobody tests for these
00:35-00:39: signals so most people walk around feeling fine never catching what's
00:39-00:42: building until it is too late but here is what saved lives when
00:42-00:46: pattern was caught every patient whose outcome changed had one thing in
00:46-00:51: their blood a unique marker that American diet just don't provide where
00:51-00:57: Where does it come from? Old world traditions. Garlic, slow-aged for 730 days in cool cellars
00:57-01:03: just like in Japanese mountain villages Swiss Highland and Amish barns not the stuff on supermarket shelves
01:03-01:06: Only the real two year transformation unlocks
01:06-01:07: It that's why LRA is different
01:07-01:10: It isn't a shortcut or trendy extract
01:10-01:10: Its real
01:10-01:13: 730 day aged garlic
01:13-01:13: Time
01:13-01:14: Patience
01:14-01:14: Chemistry
01:14-01:15: All done right
01:15-01:17: The way your body can actually use
01:17-01:20: It's the same process ancient families trusted,
01:20-01:22: now available in every capsule.
01:22-01:25: You don't need a map to village or connection to farmer
01:25-01:27: just the will change your blood before your next test
01:28-01:30: before you're healthy numbers betraying
01:30-01:32: Dont wait become another story in lab freezer
01:32-01:35: Let your blood carry same markers survivors had
