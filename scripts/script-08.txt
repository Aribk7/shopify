00:00-00:02: My new doctor shook my hand and paused, didn't let go.
00:02-00:04: Just held it there testing then he said
00:04-00:06: your grip's weaker than your chart says it should be
00:06-00:10: weak grip in men over 50 is a bigger heart attack predictor than cholesterol
00:10-00:12: test your strength and you'll know your risk
00:12-00:14: that shook me I thought was indecent shape
00:14-00:15: blood pressure wasn' t terrible
00:15-00:17: cholesterol was manageable
00:17-00:17: but by handshake
00:17-00:19: something had done automatically
00:19-00:19: for all life
00:19-00:21: just became death sentence predictor
00:21-00:23: He pulls out this grip strength meter
00:23-00:24: squeeze as hard at can
00:24-00:26: do the needle barely moves
00:26-00:30: He says, your grip is like a fuel gauge for your entire vascular system.
00:30-00:34: When your arteries lose flexibility blood can't reach your extremities with force anymore
00:34-00:35: Weak grip means weak flow
00:35-00:37: Your vessels are like old garden hoses
00:37-00:37: Cracked
00:38-00:38: Stiff
00:38-00:39: No pressure left
00:39-00:40: I'm thinking about my father-in law
00:40-00:42: Last few years of his life
00:42-00:43: Couldn´t open jars
00:43-00:44: Couldn' hold the fishing rod steady
00:44-00:46: Died from massive heart attack at 66
00:46-00:48: His handshake had been warning us fo years
00:48-00:49: i asked the doc
00:49-00:50: So what do we to?
00:50-00:51: What fixes this
00:51-00:52: he leans back
00:52-00:52: Says
00:52-00:53: Here's problem
00:53-00:56: Nothing I can prescribe actually restores vessel flexibility.
00:56-01:00: Blood pressure meds lower your numbers, but your arteries stay stiff as concrete
01:00-01:03: Statins manage cholesterol but they don't bring back elasticity
01:03-01:05: We're managing symptoms not rebuilding the engine
01:05-01:07: So i'm just supposed to accept this?
01:07-01:08: He shakes his head
01:08-01:10: There's research
01:10-01:10: Decades of it
01:10-01:13: Showing certain populations never lose their grip strength
01:13-01:14: Swiss mountain villagers
01:14-01:16: Japanese island communities
01:16-01:17: Old school Amish farmers
01:17-01:19: All of them have one thing in common
01:19-01:20: They eat foods that take years
01:20-01:26: to prepare. Specifically, garlic aged in root cellars for 730 days that aging process creates
01:50-01:54: You need the full 730 day transformation or it's just expensive seasoning.
01:54-01:59: He writes down a name on his prescription pad, Ella Ray says only company I found doing
01:59-02:03: real two year aging my father-in laws on it his grip came back in six months
02:03-02:07: can't officially prescribe but im telling you as one guy to another this is what
02:07-02:07: actually works
02:07-02:11: ordered at that night started taking 1 soft gel every morning four months later
02:11-02:16: and hardware store grab 50 pound bag of concrete mix lifted like its nothing
02:16-02:19: hadn'been able do that five years without hands cramping
02:19-02:21: Six months in, I go back to that doctor.
02:21-02:24: Same handshake test this time he smiles says now
02:24-02:26: that's a grip your vessels are coming back
02:26-02:27: Your handshake doesn't lie
02:27-02:29: It is your body pressure gauge
02:29-02:30: Your vascular truth detector
02:30-02:31: If you're grips gone soft
02:31-02:33: Your arteries are sending the first warning
02:33-02:34: Don' t wait for heart attack
02:34-02:36: To confirm what you hand shake already knows
02:36-02:37: Get Eloray
02:37-02:38: The only aged garlic
02:38-02:39: That rebuilds
02:39-02:41: What blood pressure med can touch
02:41-02:42: Restore grip before
02:42-02:44: You lose hold on everything else
