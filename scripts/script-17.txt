00:00-00:02: I went to my cardiologist's funeral last week.
00:02-00:05: He was 67, died of the same heart condition he'd been treating me for at
00:05-00:09: the reception his daughter also a doctor pulled me aside she was angry
00:09-00:11: She said you were him patient for how long?
00:11-00:12: i said 12 years
00:12-00:13: She nodded
00:13-00:15: You knew there is something better than those pills
00:15-00:18: But couldn't recommend it without FDA approving in this treatment
00:18-00:19: It loses license
00:19-00:20: So we took pills too
00:20-00:21: And they killed him
00:21-00:23: They handed us USB drive
00:23-00:24: This everything couldn´t tell
00:24-00:25: Studies protocols
00:25-00:29: 24 month age garlic compound that reverses arterial damage
00:29-00:32: He started taking it himself three months before he died.
00:32-00:33: Too late, but you still have time."
00:33-00:35: He wanted his patients to know that's why I'm here
00:35-00:37: i sat in my car and that church parking lot
00:37-00:40: and opened the USB on My laptop 17 folders
00:40-00:41: 12 years of research
00:41-00:44: You couldn't share first file was dated 2013
00:44-00:46: clinical study from Japan
00:46-00:48: 730 day aged garlic extract
00:48-00:50: reduced arterial plaque by 64%
00:50-00:51: In 18 months
00:51-00:53: It highlighted one sentence
00:53-00:54: participants showed reversal
00:54-00:55: Of damage not management
00:55-00:56: of symptoms.
01:25-01:31: I kept reading he found Amish suppliers in Pennsylvania aging garlic for over 900 days sent samples to labs
01:32-01:37: Results showed three hundred forty percent higher s allyl cysteine than commercial brands a compound that actually dissolves
01:38-01:43: Arterial calcium instead of just lowering pressure. He wrote commercial aged garlic companies claimed
01:43-01:50: 730 days, but i've verified most age 180 to 240 days then add synthetic compounds only one company
01:50-01:54: found actually ages the full period, LRA. They lost every retail contract because
01:54-01:58: they refused to cut corners now they're direct only that's why my patients never
01:58-02:01: heard of them and why I'm going to die having prescribed the wrong thing for
02:01-02:04: 30 years last file on The Drive was a video dated two months before he died
02:04-02:08: him sitting at his desk home looking exhausted if you're watching this
02:08-02:09: im gone
02:09-02:13: waited too long started lra three months ago by calcium score is dropping but
02:13-02:16: damages 2 severe should have taken this 15 year
02:16-02:19: ago instead of the pills I was prescribing. To my patients,
02:19-02:22: couldn't recommend this while i was alive medical board would have destroyed
02:22-02:25: me but im dead now they cant touch me take LRA one soft gel daily
02:25-02:28: 7500 milligrams a real
02:28-02:31: 730 day age garlic not the fake retail versions
02:31-02:33: The Real One you still have time to reverse thi
02:33-02:34: didnt order it from
02:34-02:36: My car handshaking
02:36-02:37: one soft gel every morning what
02:37-02:40: But my cardiologist took too late but wanted me to take now.
02:40-02:46: Week 4, blood pressure dropped from 162 over 94 to 151 over 88
02:46-02:48: Week 8 143 over 188
02:48-02:50: Weeks 12 134
02:50-02:51: Over 80
02:51-02:53: week16 I got an arterial calcium scan
02:53-02:56: Doctor said your score dropped 38% in four months
02:56-02:58: i've never seen this with medication
02:58-03:00: He asked what it was
03:00-03:02: told him about the USB drive
03:02-03:04: My cardiologist researched
03:04-03:05: His death
03:05-03:07: his daughter handing everything he couldn't say while alive
03:07-03:08: The doctor said, he knew this worked?
03:08-03:09: I said he knew.
03:09-03:12: He couldn't tell us so we took the pills and they killed him
03:12-03:14: My new cardiologist wrote down LRA
03:14-03:17: Said if it reversed 38% of your damage in four months
03:17-03:18: i need to know about this
03:18-03:20: .I said you now
03:20-03:20: Tthe question is whether
03:20-03:21: You're brave enough
03:21-03:22: To tell your patients
03:22-03:23: lra
03:23-03:24: One soft gel
03:24-03:25: 730 days
03:25-03:26: Of real aging
03:26-03:27: What my cardiologist discovered
03:27-03:28: Used too late
03:28-03:29: And wanted every one
03:29-03:30: His patients
03:30-03:30: Know before
03:30-03:31: They ended up where
03:31-03:31: Did
03:31-03:32: his daughter gave 11
03:32-03:34: Us that USB drive
03:34-03:34: All
03:34-03:35: Is long term
03:35-03:35: Patients
03:35-03:35: She
03:35-03:39: said, he died following the rules. Don't follow them into the grave get it now
03:39-03:42: because the cardiologists who know that truth can say it without losing
03:42-03:46: everything but dead ones can be silenced anymore and they're screaming
