00:00-00:04: Your car gives you a dashboard warning before the engine dies, so why doesn't your body?
00:04-00:08: New science shows the first sign for major health disasters isn´t pain but
00:08-00:10: A hidden marker in your blood.
00:10-00:13: Most people never see the light come on before it's too late
00:13-00:13: Think about i
00:13-00:15: Your engines coolant drops
00:15-00:16: The light flashes red
00:16-00:17: You ignore
00:17-00:18: Keep driving
00:18-00:18: And boom
00:18-00:21: Engine seizes at 70 miles per hour
00:21-00:23: Same thing happens inside your body
00:23-00:24: Blood starts thickening
00:24-00:26: Vessels start clogging
00:26-00:27: Clots starts forming
00:27-00:27: No pain
00:27-00:31: No symptoms, just a silent countdown to disaster.
00:31-00:33: By the time you feel something it's game over."
00:33-00:37: My uncle was mechanic for 40 years fixed engines his whole life
00:37-00:39: never ignored dashboard warning
00:39-00:40: but when it came to his own body
00:40-00:43: trusted is doctor who said your blood work looks fine
00:43-00:46: three months later massive stroke at 62
00:46-00:47: dead before the ambulance arrived
00:48-00:48: At this funeral
00:48-00:51: His son my cousin pulled me aside
00:51-00:53: He has vascular researcher John Hopkins
00:53-00:55: said dad blood work wasn't fine
00:55-00:58: Nobody ran the test that actually matters.
00:58-01:01: His blood viscosity was off the charts for two years,
01:01-01:03: his check engine light was screaming
01:03-01:06: but doctors don't measure it because there's no pill to fix it."
01:06-01:08: I said so what the hell fixes tha-
01:08-01:10: He looks around like he is about say something
01:10-01:12: then says
01:12-01:16: in our lab we've been studying why certain populations never throw clots
01:16-01:20: Swiss mountain villages Japanese islands Amish communities
01:20-01:22: zero correlation genetics
01:22-01:23: everything points one thing
01:23-01:27: They all age garlic in root cellars for 730 days.
01:27-01:29: Not regular garlic, transformed garlic."
01:29-01:32: He pulls out his phone and shows me microscope images
01:32-01:35: This is blood before thick sticky blots forming
01:35-01:39: This is blood after six months of 730 day aged garlic
01:39-01:42: Slick clean like motor oil versus water
01:42-01:45: S-allylsysteine the compound that only forms after
01:45-01:48: seven hundred thirty days flips the dashboard from
01:48-01:50: red to green at molecular level
01:50-01:56: He sends me a link, says there's only one company in America doing real 730-day aging.
01:56-01:56: LRAE
01:56-02:00: Everyone else rushes it to save money but you can't rush chemistry
02:00-02:02: It takes 730 days or it doesn' t work
02:02-02:03: I ordered at that night
02:03-02:05: Started taking every morning
02:05-02:06: One soft gel
02:06-02:08: Seven thousand five hundred milligrams of real
02:08-02:11: seven hundred thirty day aged garlic
02:11-02:11: Six months later
02:11-02:14: get my blood viscosity tested for the first time
02:14-02:15: In My Life
02:15-02:16: Doctor looks confused
02:16-02:18: Says your blood flows like 30 year olds
02:18-02:19: What are you doing?
02:19-02:21: I tell him about my uncle, about Eloray.
02:21-02:23: He writes it down and says
02:23-02:24: ''I'm putting my dad on this!
02:24-02:27: he's 68 and his blood has been thickening for years.''
02:27-02:28: My cousin was right
02:28-02:30: the dashboard warning was there all along
02:30-02:32: we just weren't looking at the right gauge
02:32-02:34: Eloray fixed what doctors can''t measure
02:34-02:35: And pills can'nt touch
02:35-02:37: It turned by check engine light off
02:37-02:38: before that engine ever failed
02:38-02:40: Don´T ignore a warniung you cant see
02:40-02:41: Get Eloray
02:41-02:43: Fixed your problem before your body is
02:43-02:44: On side of road
02:44-02:44: Engine dead
02:44-02:46: Wondering why nobody told you
02:46-02:47: The lights were off
02:47-02:47: Light broke
