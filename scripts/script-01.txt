00:00-00:04: Viagra stopped working. Urologist said it's not testosterone, your penile blood flow is
00:04-00:06: restricted somethings blocking the vessels
00:06-00:09: Ultrasound showed microclots in penile arteries
00:09-00:12: He said viagara dilates vessels but if they're clogged with clots
00:12-00:15: dilation doesn't matter you've got a plumbing problem not chemical
00:15-00:17: ED was warning sign of systemic clotting
00:17-00:20: I'm 58 this has been problem for two years tried viagra
00:20-00:23: worked for six months then stopped tried Cialis same thing
00:23-00:27: doctor kept increasing doses nothing finally urologists orders
00:27-00:29: Penile Doppler Ultrasound, looks at the screen.
00:30-00:33: Goes quiet then says your arteries are full of micro clots
00:33-00:34: See these dark spots?
00:34-00:36: Those are clots blocking blood flow
00:36-00:37: Viagra can't fix that
00:37-00:38: You don´t have an erection problem
00:38-00:39: You have a circulation problem
00:39-00:41: I say what about blood thinners
00:41-00:43: He says blood thinners stop new clotts
00:43-00:44: They do not dissolve old ones
00:44-00:45: You've got years
00:45-00:46: Of clottes built up in this vessels
00:46-00:47: And if it's in your penis
00:47-00:49: It is on your heart and brain too
00:49-00:50: ED usually the first symptom
00:50-00:51: Systemic Clotting
00:51-00:52: Because penil arteries
00:52-00:53: Are smallest
00:53-00:54: They clog first
00:54-00:56: Sends me for full vascular screening
00:56-00:59: D-Dimer 3.8, Coronary Calcium score 340
00:59-01:02: Carotid Ultrasound shows clots in neck arteries
