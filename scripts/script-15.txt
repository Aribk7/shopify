00:00-00:05: Trucker told me his DOT physical got revoked, blood pressure over 140 over 90.
00:05-00:09: Lost his CDL lost his job three months later I see him working construction
00:09-00:12: hauling ninety pound bags of concrete no medical clearance needed can't drive a
00:12-00:14: truck and carry weight that'll blow is hard makes
00:14-00:17: No sense until you realize it's not about safety
00:17-00:19: i ran into them at the gas station six months after
00:19-00:21: that he wasn' t wearing construction gear
00:21-00:23: He was in this trucker jacket climbing
00:23-00:23: Into A big rig
00:23-00:24: I said,
00:24-00:25: ''I thought you lost your CDL?''
00:25-00:26: He smiled.
00:26-00:27: Got it back
00:27-00:27: i asked how
00:27-00:29: Doctor finally put you on meds?
00:29-00:30: he said no
00:30-00:32: Met an old Amish man at a farmer's market
00:32-00:33: Guy was selling produce
00:33-00:36: l wasn't buying apples and complaining about losing my CDl
00:36-00:38: Stopped packing bag looked me
00:38-00:39: Your problem isnt your blood
00:39-00:40: It is your vessels
00:40-00:40: They are stiff
00:40-00:44: Blood pressure just blood trying to move through pipes that lost their flexibility
00:44-00:46: The trucker said the amish man told him wait there
00:46-00:48: Came back 10 minutes later with jar
00:48-00:49: Black stuff inside
00:49-00:52: Said its been aging in his cellar since 2021
00:52-00:53: Over 900 days underground
00:53-00:55: Take this every day, the Amish man told him.
00:55-00:57: It's how we keep our vessels soft
00:57-01:01: Sulphur transforms into S-allylcysteine after 730 days
01:01-01:04: That compound gives your arteries back what time and stress took away
01:05-01:06: The trucker asked where he could get more
01:06-01:09: The Amish man said his community supplies one American company
01:09-01:10: Eloray
01:10-01:13: Only one that respects the full 730 day aging
01:13-01:15: Everyone else rushes it at 200 or 300 days
01:15-01:16: Doesn't work
01:16-01:18: Compound never fully develops
01:18-01:19: Six months later that trucker to me
01:19-01:21: I retested my DOT physical

01:35-01:37: one soft gel daily
01:37-01:40: 7500 milligrams of that exact compound
01:40-01:41: the Amish man gave him
01:41-01:43: That conversation hit hard because I'm 58
01:43-01:45: My blood pressure's been creeping
01:45-01:47: 142 over 88 now
01:47-01:50: Doctor has been pushing Lisinopril for 6 months
01:50-01:53: I've been avoiding it because i know what happens, you start you never stop and the
01:53-01:55: side effects steal your energy your focus

02:22-02:25: The difference between being disqualified from your livelihood
02:25-02:26: and getting it back
02:26-02:28: Get it now because your next physical is coming
02:28-02:31: And the choice's medication compliance or actual restoration
