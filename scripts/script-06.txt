00:00-00:04: Handyman was at my house fixing a door. I'm standing there watching him work and out of nowhere
00:04-00:10: He braces his hand on the door frame goes still for second then looks at me and says you ever check your blood pressure like
00:10-00:11: This, i said what do you mean like that?
00:12-00:15: he says put your hand flat on the wall press hard now pay attention to
00:15-00:16: Your wrist in temples if You feel
00:16-00:17: Your pulse race If
00:17-00:18: Feel it pounding
00:18-00:20: YoUR ARTERIES ARE FIGHTING EACH HEARTBEAT
00:20-00:22: SMOOTH LOW MEANS NO POUND
00:22-00:23: THE POUND MEANS TROUBLE ON THE INSIDE
00:23-00:28: I tried it and felt it, this hard aggressive thump in my wrist like my blood was slamming
00:28-00:29: through pipes that were too narrow.
00:29-00:31: He says thats called water hammer
00:31-00:33: In plumbing when water hits a closed valve to hard
00:33-00:35: It creates shock wave
00:35-00:36: Your arteries are doing the same thing
00:36-00:38: Every beat is collision not flow
00:38-00:41: That pounding wears down your vessels from inside
00:41-00:42: Eventually something bursts
00:42-00:43: That hit me hard because
00:43-00:46: My brother died of brain aneurysm at 62
00:46-00:47: Just collapsed one day
00:47-00:48: No warning
00:48-00:49: But now Im wondering
00:49-00:50: Did he feel tha pounding?
00:50-00:51: did his body warn him
00:51-00:52: And just never knew what meant
00:52-00:54: I asked the handyman, so what do you do about it?
00:54-00:56: He wipes his hand. Says
00:56-00:56: Im 68
00:56-00:58: i used to feel that pound every single day
00:58-00:59: then a cardiologist
00:59-01:01: told me about what the old guys in
01:01-01:02: this family used
01:02-01:04: eat aged garlic from root cellars
01:04-01:05: not stuff
01:05-01:06: and grocery stores
01:06-01:07: real aged garlic
01:07-01:08: 730 days
01:08-01:09: its only thing
01:09-01:11: that makes arteries flexible enough
01:11-01:12: absorb pressure
01:12-01:13: instead of fighting
01:13-01:13: he pulls out
01:13-01:14: is phone
01:14-01:14: shows
01:14-01:15: my name

01:19-01:20: difference
01:20-01:21: but here's how
01:21-01:21: went down
01:21-01:21: for
01:21-01:23: Week 1, nothing. Just taking it and waiting
01:24-01:26: Week 2 still nothing noticeable but I trusted the process
01:27-01:29: Week 3 started sleeping better didn't think much of it
01:30-01:32: Wee 4 realized that wasn' t getting those afternoon headaches anymore
01:33-01:34: The ones tha felt like pressure building behind my eyes
01:35-01:36: week 5 tried door frame test again
01:37-01:39: Pounding was still there bu lighter less aggressive
01:40-01:41: wee 6 hand stopped going numb at night
01:42-01:43: used to wake up with dead hands gone
01:44-01:45: w7 felt smooth flow
01:46-01:47: put hand on wall pulse was ther
01:48-01:49: But not fighting any more just moving
01:49-01:52: It was just moving week 8. I went back to my cardiologist
01:52-01:56: He checked my pressure and said whatever you're doing your arterial compliance
01:56-01:59: Just went up 40% your vessels are behaving like they're 20 years younger
01:59-02:06: he says that's the difference between a water hammer and smooth flow LRA doesn't force your pressure down with chemicals it rebuilds the
02:06-02:09: Flexibility so, Your arteries can handle The pressure naturally
02:09-02:09: i ordered at that night
02:09-02:10: started taking
02:10-02:14: it every morning, I'm on week six right now. Pounding's fading my temples don't
02:14-02:18: throb anymore when i stand up fast try the door frame test right now put your
02:18-02:21: hand flat on the wall and feel what happening inside if you feel that pound
02:21-02:24: your arteries are screaming a warning you've been ignoring get Eloray eight
02:24-02:28: weeks from know you'll put her hand in tha same wall and feel what smooth flow
02:28-02:30: actually means before water hammer breaks something
02:30-02:31: you can't fix.
