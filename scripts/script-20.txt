00:00-00:03: Pharmacist filled the wrong prescription, gave me someone else's bag with the exact
00:03-00:05: same blood pressure meds I take.
00:05-00:07: i googled the name on bottle found his obituary
00:07-00:10: died three weeks ago heart attack age 67
00:10-00:12: same medications same dosage
00:12-00:15: return my prescription and walked out because
00:15-00:16: because realized that was staring at
00:16-00:18: in a paper bag
00:18-00:22: Richard Patterson aged sixty-seven took glycinopril twenty milligrams
00:22-00:24: and amlodipine ten milligrams for eleven years
00:24-00:26: perfect compliance never missed dose according to
00:26-00:30: his refill history. Dead of acute myocardial infarction three weeks ago
00:30-00:35: I'm 64 same medications, same dosages year 9 of perfect compliance
00:35-00:40: i sat in My car and that cvs parking lot for 30 minutes just staring at his name on the bottle then
00:40-00:41: Then did something
00:41-00:41: Have never done before
00:41-00:42: Before
00:42-00:43: Called the pharmacy
00:43-00:47: Asked if they could tell me how many refills Richard Patterson had picked up before he died
00:47-00:48: The tech said she couldn't give
00:48-00:49: Me that information
00:49-00:50: He's dead
00:50-00:50: Prescription

00:51-00:51: Hand
00:51-00:52: Just need to know
00:52-00:52: If
00:52-00:52: That
00:52-00:53: Medications
00:53-00:53: Work
00:53-00:53: She went
00:53-00:54: Quiet
00:54-00:59: Then she said, sir everyone who takes those medications picks them up until they don't anymore. That's all I can tell you
00:59-01:02: That is when i understood the medications dont prevent the heart attack
01:02-01:04: They postpone it while keeping you dependent
01:04-01:06: Spent that night researching
01:06-01:11: Found a study comparing medicated vs unmedicated patients with high blood pressure over 20 years
01:11-01:14: The medicated group lived an average of 71 point 4 years
01:14-01:17: Unmedicate group who changed their approach
01:17-01:19: Lived in average 83 point 8 years
01:19-01:20: 12 Years
01:20-01:23: Thats difference between compliance and finding another way
01:23-01:27: I started looking for the people who refuse medication and live longer found them in the same place
01:27-01:33: They always are Amish communities in Pennsylvania drove to Lancaster County the next morning found a farmer working his land
01:33-01:35: He was 78 moving like he was 50.
01:35-01:36: told him what happened at CVS
01:36-01:42: The medication keeps your vessels tight while lowering pressure inside them eventually tight vessels crack
01:42-01:43: That's heart attack
01:43-01:48: He took me to his cellar showed me jars aid since 2021 over 900 days
01:48-01:50: This is what teaches your vessels. To stay soft
01:50-01:56: he said sulfur compounds break down over seven hundred and thirty days into s allyl cysteine that compound restores elasticity
01:57-02:02: Soft vessels don't need force tight vessels do medication controls the force this restores the softness
02:03-02:04: I asked where i could get it
