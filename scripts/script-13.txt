00:00-00:06: CDC study buried in 2019 showed Amish men have 74% fewer prostate cancer deaths than
00:06-00:10: American men, but the lead researcher was fired before publication.
00:30-00:33: The handwriting gets harder to read every time I open it because i've looked at
00:33-00:37: It a thousand times that note is the last thing my father ever wrote and he used what little strength
00:37-00:42: He had left to write three words fine sellers promise five months after his funeral.
00:42-00:43: Find that CDC study
00:43-00:48: Somehow knew about buried researcher fired data deleted from public databases, but
00:48-00:52: But found an archived version 74% fewer prostate cancer deaths in Amish men
00:52-00:54: The study was terminated because then
00:54-00:56: and I quote from internal emails,
00:56-00:59: further investigation would undermine current treatment protocols
00:59-01:00: and pharmaceutical partnerships.
01:00-01:02: They buried it because it worked too well."
01:03-01:06: My father a union man who wired electrical systems for 38 years
01:06-01:09: died not knowing the answer was 40 miles from his house
01:09-01:12: and someone at the CDC made sure he'd never find out
01:12-01:16: .I drive to Holmes County Ohio largest Amish settlement in America
01:16-01:17: ,i walk onto farm
01:17-01:19: And find 66 year old man named Isaac wiring
01:19-01:21: A barn same work my father did
01:21-01:22: His whole life
01:22-01:27: I say, CDC buried a study showing Amish men don't die from prostate cancer like we do.
01:27-01:29: Why? He stops working and looks at me
01:29-01:31: You're the third person this year asking that question
01:31-01:31: Come
01:31-01:33: We walk to his root cellar
01:33-01:34: He opens the door
01:34-01:35: Cool darkness
01:35-01:35: The smell
01:35-01:36: Ancient
01:36-01:37: Like something older than medicine itself
01:38-01:39: Rows of bulbs hanging
01:39-01:39: Grabs one
01:39-01:40: Black
01:40-01:40: Dense
01:40-01:41: Hands it
01:41-01:42: Your father wired buildings
01:42-01:44: Electrical systems
01:44-01:46: Do you know how electricity works
01:46-01:46: Nod
01:46-01:49: Cancer is like short circuit in your body's wiring
01:49-01:51: Cells get wrong signal
01:51-01:52: They multiply when they shouldn't.
01:52-01:55: Hormone therapy tries to cut the power to stop the short,
01:55-01:57: but cutting power in one circuit affects whole system
01:57-01:59: That's why your father bones got brittle
01:59-02:01: Treatment shut down circuits he needed
02:01-02:02: He holds up a bulb
02:02-02:04: This has been aging for 840 days
02:04-02:05: Over 2 years
02:05-02:09: During that time harsh sulfur transforms into S-allyl cysteine
02:09-02:12: That compound doesn´t cuts power stops short circuits
02:12-02:14: It fixes wiring so shorts don happen
02:14-02:17: it tells cancer cells stop multiplying before they start
02:17-02:22: That metaphor hit me like 240 volts, because my father understood systems.
02:22-02:24: And he died because his doctors didn't fix the system
02:24-02:27: they just cut the power until his whole body shut down
02:27-02:28: Isaac says
02:28-02:31: The CDC researcher? I met him 2018
02:31-02:33: He came here saw our cellars tested our garlic
02:33-02:39: found out 730 day aging creates compound levels 380% higher than commercial products
02:39-02:40: It was going to publish
02:40-02:41: Then it got fired
02:41-02:42: Study disappeared
02:42-02:46: He told me before he left, they won't let me say it publicly but you already know.
02:46-02:49: This prevents what we spend billions trying to manage
02:49-02:51: I ask where someone like can get what's in that cellar
02:51-02:53: We supply one company Isaac says
02:53-02:54: Helleray
02:54-02:56: Only American company aging it properly
02:56-02:58: 730 days minimum
02:58-03:00: Same process used since the 1800s
03:00-03:03: Most companies rush at 180-200 days for profit
03:03-03:05: But the electrical transformation
03:05-03:07: Sulphur S allyl cysteine
03:07-03:09: Takes 730 days
03:09-03:10: Can shortcut chemistry
03:10-03:13: He writes it down on paper, same way my father wrote his final note.
03:13-03:17: I ordered it from Isaac's driveway pulling out that note doing what my father couldn't
03:17-03:18: Six months later
03:18-03:19: My urologist calls
03:19-03:22: Your PSA dropped from 8 point 2 to two point one
03:22-03:24: Your prostate inflammation markers are the lowest
03:24-03:26: have ever seen in a patient your age
03:26-03:27: What are you doing?
03:27-03:29: Tell him about the CDC study
03:29-03:30: The buried data
03:30-03:30: That sellers
03:30-03:31: LRA
03:31-03:31: he says
03:31-03:33: can recommend tha officially
03:33-03:33: But off
03:33-03:34: record
03:34-03:35: In 26 years
03:35-03:39: I've never seen PSA levels drop that fast without medical intervention.
03:39-03:41: i said, this is medical intervention just not yours
03:41-03:47: my father spent $190k dying while the CDC knew the answer existed and buried it
03:47-03:50: Eloray ages garlic for 730 days
03:50-03:50: can't be rushed
03:50-03:53: limited supply because real aging takes real time
03:53-03:55: don' wait for the diagnosis
03:55-03:58: Don''t wait someone you love to write their last words with a shaking hand
03:58-03:59: Amish know
03:59-03:59: find sellers
03:59-04:00: promise
04:00-04:01: I found the cellars.
04:01-04:07: Im keeping that promise, and if this prevents one person from going from 240 pounds to 160
04:07-04:10: pounds in 9 months because hormone therapy destroyed what cancer didn't
04:10-04:12: my father's death means something
04:12-04:13: Get LRA now
04:13-04:15: Because the CDC buried the study
04:15-04:18: But they cant bury truth when your living proof it works
