00:00-00:05: Swiss Amish settlements have 44% fewer colon cancer cases than non-Amish populations, but
00:05-00:09: doctors can't explain it until you see their 730 day aging process.
00:09-00:13: My stepfather was a decent mechanic—toughest hands I ever shook—never complained about
00:13-00:14: pain his whole life!
00:14-00:17: Colon cancer consumed him at 61 in 16 months
00:17-00:19: Chemo and radiation left him unrecognizable
00:19-00:22: Three hours before he died he grabbed my forearm
00:22-00:24: Squeezed is so hard that bruised and said
00:24-00:25: They have the answer
00:25-00:25: In their cellars
00:25-00:26: Find It
00:26-00:28: Promise me you won' die like did
00:28-00:29: That bruise lasted three weeks
00:29-00:30: Every time I looked at it,
00:30-00:31: i heard his voice.
00:31-00:32: Find him."
00:32-00:33: Four months after his funeral
00:33-00:34: im reading about Swiss Amish
00:34-00:37: having 44% fewer colon cancer cases
00:37-00:38: and something snaps
00:38-00:39: He knew
00:39-00:40: Dying in that hospital bed
00:40-00:41: unable to speak
00:41-00:42: he somehow knew there was an answer
00:42-00:43: In a cellar somewhere
00:44-00:45: Idrived Adams County Ohio
00:45-00:46: Swiss Amish settlement
00:46-00:47: No appointment
00:47-00:48: Just rage
00:48-00:48: And promise
00:48-00:50: id find this 69 year old man named Eli
00:50-00:52: Rebuilding the tractor engine
00:52-00:54: Same work my stepfather did for 40 years
00:54-00:55: ID say
00:55-00:57: Swiss amsh don't die from colon cancer
00:57-00:58: Like the rest of us
00:58-00:58: Why?
00:58-01:00: He wipes his hands, come with me.
01:00-01:02: We walk to his barn opens the cellar door
01:02-01:05: The smell hits not garlic but something ancient
01:05-01:06: like the earth was keeping a secret
01:06-01:08: rows of bulbs hanging in darkness
01:08-01:09: he grabs one hands it
01:09-01:12: black dense been here since 2022
01:12-01:14: over 1000 days
01:14-01:15: you know why cancer ate your stepfather
01:15-01:17: your body's like diesel engine
01:17-01:19: cancer is sludge building in fuel lines
01:19-01:21: chemo pours chemicals through trying
01:21-01:22: flush out
01:22-01:23: but chemicals destroy
01:23-01:24: engine while they fight
01:24-01:25: sludge
01:25-01:25: holds up
01:25-01:26: bulb
01:26-01:26: this prevents
01:26-01:33: the sludge from ever forming. 730 days transforms harsh sulfur into S-allyl cysteine, that compound
01:33-01:36: keeps your fuel lines clean from day one no buildup no sludge
01:36-01:40: No cancer mechanics prevent breakdowns doctors manage them we prevent
01:40-01:44: That metaphor destroyed me because my stepfather rebuilt engines by cleaning
01:44-01:48: them not destroying them and he died because medicine destroys to save
01:48-01:50: I ask where someone like Me can get this
01:50-01:54: We supply one company Eli says LRA only company in America aging it properly
01:54-01:58: 730 days minimum, same process we've used for 200 years.
01:58-02:02: Most companies rush it at 200-300 days for faster profits
02:02-02:05: but the transformation takes 73o days can't rush it."
02:05-02:06: He writes down
02:06-02:10: Same way my stepfather's doctor wrote down chemoprotocols that failed
02:10-02:12: I ordered from his driveway hands shaking
02:12-02:15: doing what my step father couldn tdo preventing instead of managing
02:15-02:17: 8 months later My doctor calls
02:17-02:20: Your CEA tumor markers dropped 68%
02:20-02:22: From 12 point 4 to four point zero
02:22-02:26: Your colon inflammation markers are normal for the first time in years, what changed?
02:26-02:27: I tell him.
02:27-02:28: He says in 24 years
02:28-02:32: he'd never seen cancer predictor levels reverse like this without intervention
02:32-02:34: and said thi is intervention just not yours
02:34-02:38: My stepfather spent $310k dying while this was aging
02:38-02:40: In Swiss Amish cellars 90 miles away
02:40-02:43: LRA takes 730 days to age
02:43-02:43: Can't be rushed
02:43-02:46: Limited supply because real aging takes real time
02:46-02:48: Dont wait for diagnosis
02:48-02:49: Dont wait someone you love
02:49-02:51: To grab your arm so hard it bruises
02:51-02:53: and beg you to find what they couldn't. I still have that bruise scar,
02:54-02:55: i look at it every day
02:55-02:56: Find It! Promise me
02:56-02:56: Found It
02:56-02:58: Im keeping that promise
02:58-03:01: And if this prevents one person from going through what he went through
03:01-03:03: 16 months of chemo destroying
03:03-03:03: What cancer didn´T
03:03-03:05: Is death means something
03:05-03:06: Get LRA now
03:06-03:08: Because prevention isnít managing the sludge
03:08-03:11: Its keeping the engine clean so sludge never forms
