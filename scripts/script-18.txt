00:00-00:02: Prison health system doctor said something that broke me.
00:02-00:07: Inmates refuse blood pressure medication at 10 times the rate of the general population,
00:07-00:09: they don't trust the system and statistically
00:09-00:13: they live longer post-release than inmates who complied with medication protocols
00:13-00:16: The ones who refused and found alternatives are still alive
00:16-00:19: They compliant ones are dead within 5 years release
00:19-00:22: He said this affects sentencing decisions nobody talks about
00:22-00:24: Now folks I need you to understand something
00:24-00:28: This doctor worked in federal prison system for 18 years
00:28-00:32: He's not anti-medicine, he is anti dying and what he told me turned everything I thought
00:32-00:34: knew upside down.
00:34-00:38: The prison system is the only place in America where you can track medication compliance
00:38-00:43: AND long term survival with perfect accuracy because every inmate has a release date
00:43-00:46: And knows exactly who still alive 5 10 15 years later
00:46-00:47: This numbers are brutal
00:47-00:50: Inmates who took blood pressure medication throughout their sentence
00:50-00:53: Average life span post release 4 point 7 year
00:53-00:59: Inmates who refused and managed it naturally, average life span post-release 14.3 years
00:59-01:00: Same population
01:00-01:02: Same health conditions going in
01:02-01:03: Different choices
01:03-01:04: Different outcomes
01:04-01:08: I asked him how inmates who refuse medication manage their blood pressure without pills
01:08-01:08: He said
01:08-01:11: They're more resourceful than folks on the outside
01:11-01:11: They trade for it
01:11-01:12: Barter for
01:12-01:15: It comes through family visits from Amish communities
01:15-01:17: They know something most Americans don't
01:17-01:19: He walked me to the prison commissary storage room
01:19-01:21: Showed what gets shipped monthly
01:21-01:22: Aged garlic extract
01:22-01:27: Not the regular kind, the kind that's been transformed over 730 days.
01:27-01:30: Folks in here figured it out before folks on the outside," he said
01:30-01:32: Your blood vessels are like old pipes
01:32-01:35: Medication forces water through cracked pipes by turning up
01:35-01:37: The pressure but that pressure eventually burst
01:37-01:38: This...
01:38-01:39: He held a container
01:39-01:41: This makes pipes flexible again
01:41-01:42: Rubber instead of rust
01:42-01:43: Water flows easy
01:43-01:44: No force needed
01:44-01:46: That is metaphor changed everything for me
01:46-01:48: Your arteries aren't broken they're rusty
01:48-01:50: And medication doesn' derust them
01:50-01:53: It just forces blood through rust until the rust cracks.
01:53-01:54: That crack is your heart attack."
01:54-01:58: He told me inmates source their aged garlic from one supplier,
01:58-02:01: an Amish network that supplies a company called Eloray only
02:01-02:06: company aging it properly 730 days not 200 no 300 the full
02:06-02:09: transformation period most supplement companies rush the
02:09-02:11: aging to cut costs he said inmates don't have money
02:11-02:13: To waste they need what works if i didn'
02:13-02:16: work The guys who refuse medication would be dead
02:16-02:18: They're Not there's A healthiest group I've ever tracked
02:18-02:19: Here's what shocked me.
02:19-02:23: He said judges and parole boards know about this, they see the survival data
02:23-02:26: inmates who take medication high recidivism because they're too sick to
02:26-02:30: function inmates who refused and use natural alternatives low recidivism
02:30-02:31: because they're healthy enough
02:31-02:35: To work old jobs stay alive system won't talk about it publicly he said
02:35-02:37: Because it means we've been giving folks
02:37-02:40: The wrong treatment for 40 years but privately every prison doctor knows
02:40-02:44: compliance is a death sentence I ordered LRA that day one soft gel
02:44-02:47: every morning, 7500 milligrams of real
02:47-02:50: 730 day age garlic extract. What inmates
02:50-02:52: figured out while locked up that most
02:52-02:54: folks on the outside never learned four
02:54-02:56: months later my blood pressure dropped
02:56-03:00: from 166 over 94 to 137 over 82 no
03:00-03:02: medications just one soft gel that makes
03:02-03:04: rusty pipes flexible again my doctor ran
03:04-03:07: a vascular elasticity test said
03:07-03:08: My arteries reverse 15 years
03:08-03:10: Of stiffness he asked what I changed
03:10-03:11: i told him about the prison
03:11-03:12: doctor survival data
03:12-03:14: The inmates who refuse medication and
03:14-03:18: live longer. He said, that data would never be published too controversial I
03:18-03:20: said but it's true he said that why i'll never
03:20-03:25: publish LRA one soft gel 730 days of aging what inmates in the federal prison
03:25-03:29: system figured out because their lives depended on and what folks on the
03:29-03:30: outside keep missing
03:30-03:33: because they trust a system tracks compliance not survival
03:33-03:37: The inmates who refuse medication there alive ones to complied dead within five
03:37-03:38: years
03:38-03:42: That is no opinion thats data from 18 years tracking every single outcome
03:42-03:46: Get it now, because the most surprising thing about this story isn't that inmates know better.
03:46-03:50: It's that folks on the outside with full freedom still choose compliance over survival
03:50-03:51: Don t be one of them
