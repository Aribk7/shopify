00:00-00:02: The tattoo artist refused to finish my sleeve.
00:02-00:05: Said your blood isn't clotting right, it's too thick
00:05-00:08: Been doing this 22 years I can tell by how ink bleeds under your skin
00:08-00:11: You're either diabetic or you've got micro-clotting
00:11-00:12: Im not diabetic
00:12-00:12: Got tested
00:12-00:14: Ddimer 3 point 4
00:14-00:18: My bloods so thick with micro clots it changes how tattoo ink spreads
00:18-00:19: And had zero symptoms
00:19-00:21: That tattoo artist saved me life
00:21-00:22: His name is Marcus
00:22-00:23: Shop in Pittsburgh
00:23-00:25: He showed photos on his phone
00:25-00:28: Before and after shots of tattoos on people with cloting issues
00:28-00:29: The Ink spreads differently
00:29-00:33: Bleeds into surrounding tissue like it's moving through mud instead of water.
00:33-00:37: He said I've watched three clients die in the last five years, all had the same ink
00:37-00:41: bleed pattern you've got – all died of pulmonary embolisms within 18 months!
00:41-00:43: …I started refusing to finish tattoos when
00:43-00:44: i see them…
00:44-00:45: Im not watching another one...
00:45-00:46: ...i said what da hell do ido?
00:46-00:48: he said go get your D-Dimer tested
00:48-00:52: If its over 2 point 0 your bloods thick with micro clots
00:52-00:53: doctor will put u on blood thinners
00:53-00:54: they dont work
00:54-00:56: just stop new clot while old ones stay stuck
00:56-00:57: but theres something else
00:57-00:59: Amish guy comes here twice a year
00:59-01:03: gets full sleeves. His ink spreads perfect, I asked him why he told me
01:03-01:06: Marcus pulls out his phone shows me a note the Amish guy left him
01:06-01:10: aged garlic 730 days minimum keeps blood thin naturally
01:10-01:13: dissolves old clots blood thinners manage this clears
01:13-01:18: i go get tested D-dimer 3 point 4 should be under 0 point 5
01:18-01:22: doctor says you're walking time bomb we need to start you on eloquence immediately
01:22-01:25: say what about age garlic? He says that's not FDA approved
01:25-01:26: I can't recommend it.
01:26-01:27: i say but does that work?
01:27-01:29: he looks around, lowers his voice
01:29-01:30: off the record
01:30-01:33: ive had two patients reverse d-dimer levels with aged garlic
01:33-01:34: properly aged
01:34-01:35: 730 days
01:35-01:36: but cant tell you to take

01:54-01:57: Marcus told me in 2019 my blood looked wrong.
01:57-01:59: I got tested, D-dimer 2 point 8
01:59-02:02: and started taking aged garlic from our cellars
02:02-02:04: Eight months later the d dimer dropped to 0 point 6
02:05-02:06: Marcus said my blood looked normal again
02:06-02:08: Been taking it ever since
02:08-02:09: He walks with his seller
02:09-02:11: Garlic aging since 2022
02:11-02:12: Over 1000 days
02:12-02:16: This transforms harsh sulfur into S allyl cysteine he says
02:16-02:18: That compound doesn't just stop new clots
02:18-02:21: It dissolves fibrin that holds old clots together
02:21-02:23: Like pouring dish soap on grease
02:23-02:24: The clumps break apart
02:24-02:26: I ask where someone like me can get this.
02:26-02:28: We supply one company, Levi says
02:28-02:28: Eloray
02:28-02:30: Only company aging it properly
02:30-02:32: 730 days minimum
02:32-02:34: Same process we've used for generations
02:34-02:36: Most companies rush it at 200-300 days
02:36-02:37: Doesn't work
02:37-02:39: Transformation takes 730 days
02:39-02:40: He writes down
02:40-02:41: Ordered that night
02:41-02:42: One soft gel daily
