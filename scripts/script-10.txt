00:00-00:05: In 1858, Louis Pasteur the father of modern medicine put raw garlic in a petri dish full
00:05-00:06: of bacteria.
00:06-00:08: Three days later every bacteria within an inch
00:08-00:11: Of the garlic was dead he published it in his journals called
00:11-00:13: It more powerful than anything medicine had at
00:13-00:14: The time then
00:14-00:15: 1928 penicillin
00:15-00:20: Was invented and garlic disappeared from medical textbooks overnight because pharmaceutical
00:20-00:22: Companies could patent penicillin they couldn't
00:22-00:23: Patent weed that grows
00:23-00:26: Endure during World War one British field surgeons ran out
00:26-00:31: of antibiotics. Soldiers were dying from infected wounds in the trenches, so doctors soaked
00:31-00:35: bandages in crushed garlic juice and wrapped open wounds with it – infection rates dropped
00:35-00:39: by 90%. Russian medics did the same thing during World War II – they called
00:39-00:42: is Russian penicillin saved thousands lives! Then the war ended
00:42-00:46: Big Pharma flooded hospitals with synthetic antibiotics and garlic went back to being
00:46-00:48: just cooking ingredient
00:48-00:51: But here's what Pasteur never discovered because he died before
00:51-00:51: could test
00:51-00:53: Garlic doesn't just kill bacteria
00:53-00:57: It reverses the thing that's slowly hardening your arteries and choking your heart.
00:57-01:01: In 1997, Japanese researchers took Pasteur discovery one step further
01:01-01:06: They aged garlic for 24 months in sealed vats and found something extraordinary
01:06-01:08: It reversed arterial stiffness by 21 percent
01:08-01:11: Made 70-year old blood vessels act like they were 58
01:11-01:14: They published it once then the study disappeared
01:14-01:17: Because if people knew this could replace blood pressure medication
01:17-01:21: The $28 billion hypertension drug industry collapses overnight
01:21-01:23: That 1997 discovery is Eloray.
01:23-01:28: We took Pasteur's raw garlic and aged it for two full years, 720 days in darkness
01:28-01:32: transforming harsh allicin into S-allylcysteine
01:32-01:34: the golden molecule your body actually absorbs
01:34-01:40: Robert 64 went from 169 over 95 to 132 over 80 in 10 weeks
01:40-01:43: His cardiologist said whatever you're doing don't stop
01:43-01:46: He wasn´t doing anything except taking what Pasteur proved worked
01:46-01:53: in 1858, aged the way Japanese researchers discovered it in 1997. Right now up to 70%
01:53-01:56: off while supplies last click below because Pasteur was right
01:56-01:58: In 1858 The Russians proved
01:58-01:59: It 1945
01:59-02:00: The Japanese perfected
02:00-02:01: At 1997
02:01-02:03: And your doctor still hasn't read any of
02:03-02:03: I
