00:00-00:02: Bought a box of old race medals at an estate sale.
00:02-00:08: Guy who owned them ran 47 marathons between 1998 and 2019, died in 2020
00:08-00:13: at age 59 heart attack found his running journal in the box entry from 2006
00:13-00:16: doctor put me on blood pressure medication said it's safe for runners
00:17-00:22: entry from 2014 can't break 430 anymore used to run 345 last entry
00:22-00:25: 2019 retired from running too dangerous
00:25-00:26: Heart cannot handle
00:26-00:29: The medication didn't protect his heart, it ended his ability to use it.
00:29-00:33: Now folks I sat in my car reading this journal for two hours because
00:33-00:38: Im a runner too and recognized every single milestone of decline he described
00:38-00:43: His name was Michael started running at 42 first marathon 43 by 2006
00:43-00:46: He completed 19 marathons with times getting faster every year
00:46-00:51: Then the doctor saw blood pressure 148 over 90 and put him on medication
00:51-00:52: Safe for runners the doctor said
00:52-00:54: Here's thing you need understand
00:54-00:56: Your heart is like a high-performance engine.
00:56-01:00: When you're running marathons, that engine is already working at maximum capacity
01:00-01:02: Blood pressure medication doesn't tune the engine
01:02-01:04: It restrict the fuel line
01:04-01:07: Michael's journal shows the slow death of performance
01:07-01:08: 2007
01:08-01:09: Felt sluggish on mile 18
01:09-01:10: 2008
01:10-01:11: Had to walk twice
01:11-01:12: Never happened before
01:12-01:13: 2010
01:13-01:14: Breathing feels different
01:14-01:14: Heavy
01:14-01:15: 2012
01:15-01:17: Doctor says my heart fine
01:17-01:18: Numbers are controlled
01:18-01:22: By 2014 folks he'd lost 45 minutes off his marathon time
01:22-01:23: Not because got older
01:23-01:26: because his medication was choking his cardiovascular system.
01:26-01:28: His arteries were getting stiffer while
01:28-01:30: his medication forced blood through at lower pressure,
01:30-01:33: like trying to water a garden through kinked hose
01:33-01:34: Last entry before he quit running
01:34-01:36: Chest tightness on mile 6
01:36-01:37: Had To Stop
01:37-01:38: Doctor says keep taking the pills
01:38-01:40: But the pills are what's breaking me
01:40-01:41: He died one year later
01:41-01:42: 59 years old
01:42-01:45: The medication protected him right into an early grave
01:45-01:46: I took that journal
01:46-01:47: ...to cardiologist
01:47-01:48: ..I know
01:48-01:49: Not my regular doctor
01:49-01:51: A guy who runs ultramarathons
01:51-01:53: I asked him if he'd seen this pattern before.
01:53-01:54: He said, every week
01:54-01:57: Athletes come in with perfect blood pressure while exercising
01:57-01:59: Then they sit in my office and their pressure spikes
01:59-02:01: because they're sedentary for five minutes
02:01-02:02: Put them on med's
02:02-02:04: Within two years they can't perform anymore
02:04-02:07: The medication treats the symptom but destroys the function
02:07-02:09: Asked him what runners should do instead
02:09-02:11: Look around like someone might hear us
02:11-02:11: Then said
02:11-02:14: Folks who run long term without medications
02:14-02:15: Do one thing different
02:15-02:16: They restore vessel elasticity
02:16-02:18: Instead of suppressing pressure
02:18-02:23: There's a compound, aged for 730 days that makes arteries flexible like they were at
02:23-02:24: 30.
02:24-02:26: Runners who take it keep their speed runners on meds lose it."
02:26-02:30: He wrote down Eloray said its the only company aging garlic extract properly
02:30-02:32: 730 days not rushed
02:32-02:36: The sulfur transforms into S-allyl cysteine over that time
02:36-02:39: That is the compound than turns rigid arteries back into flexible ones
02:39-02:41: Think of this he said
02:41-02:43: Your arterie are rubber bands than got left out from sun
02:43-02:44: They're brittle
02:44-02:46: Medication doesn't make them elastic again
02:46-02:48: It just reduces the tension while they stay brittle.
02:49-02:50: Eventually, brittle breaks."
02:50-02:50: This...
02:51-02:51: He tapped the paper
02:51-02:53: This makes them elastic again
02:53-02:54: I ordered Eloray that night
02:54-02:56: One soft gel every morning
02:56-03:01: 7500 mg of real 730-day aged garlic extract
03:01-03:02: What Michael never knew existed
03:02-03:03: Four months later
03:03-03:05: i ran my best 10k time in six years
03:05-03:10: Blood pressure went from 156 over 92 to 138 over 80
03:10-03:11: But here's what shocked me
03:11-03:13: My resting heart rate dropped from 68%
03:13-03:14: To 54
03:14-03:16: My recovery time between hard efforts cut in half.
03:16-03:18: My cardiologist, a marathon runner said
03:18-03:20: your cardiovascular system just reversed
03:20-03:22: the decade of stiffness you're not managing
03:22-03:23: decline anymore
03:23-03:24: You're restoring function
03:24-03:26: Michael's journal had 47 medals
03:26-03:27: and 13 years
03:27-03:28: and declined documented
03:28-03:29: in his own handwriting
03:30-03:32: His last race was 2019
03:32-03:33: He wrote I used to fly
03:33-03:33: now
03:33-03:34: Now crawl
03:34-03:35: The pills took my wings
03:35-03:36: Folks LRA didn't exist
03:36-03:37: when Michael was running
03:37-03:38: or maybe it did
03:38-03:39: And nobody told him
03:39-03:40: but It exists now
03:40-03:41: An its giving runners back
03:41-03:43: what blood pressure medication steals
03:43-03:46: the ability to actually use the heart they're trying to protect.
03:46-03:51: One soft gel daily, 730 days of transformation in every dose
03:51-03:53: what turns kinked hoses back into open pipelines
03:53-03:55: what makes brittle rubber bands elastic again
03:55-03:58: get it now because Michael's journal ends with him unable
03:58-04:00: To run mine is still going and
04:00-04:01: The only difference is I found
04:01-04:02: What he never did a way
04:02-04:05: restore instead of suppress. Don't end your story the way he ended his,
