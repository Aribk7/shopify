00:00-00:03: Downloaded my blood work from before and after the jab.
00:03-00:06: CRP inflammation marker went from 1 point 2 to 4 point 8,
00:06-00:09: D-dimer went from 0 point 3 to one poin 9
00:09-00:13: My cardiologist said this indicates ongoing microclotting in chronic inflammation
00:13-00:16: It's common post jab but nobody talks about it
00:16-00:17: I asked what reverses is
00:17-00:19: He wrote down something he said is not supposed recommend
00:19-00:20: Three months later
00:20-00:21: And numbers are back
00:21-00:22: To normal
00:22-00:22: Im sharing
00:22-00:23: What you wrote down
00:23-00:24: Now folks
00:24-00:24: Need you
00:24-00:25: Understand
00:25-00:25: With those
00:25-00:26: Numbers mean
00:26-00:27: Because most people get their blood work
00:27-00:27: Back
00:27-00:28: In a doctor
00:28-00:28: Says
00:28-00:29: Everything
00:29-00:29: Is fine
00:29-00:33: but they don't show you the trends. CRP is your inflammation marker think of it
00:33-00:36: like a smoke detector in your house before the jab my smoke detector was
00:36-00:40: reading 1 point 2 barely any smoke after the jab had jumped to 4 point 8 that's
00:40-00:43: not small fire at your house filling with smoke while
00:43-00:44: doctor tells me everything is fine because
00:44-00:47: The House Hasn'T Burned Down Yet D-Dimer measures micro clots
00:47-00:50: In Your Bloodstream Folks This Is Where It Gets Scary Normal
00:50-00:53: Under 0 Point 5 Mine Went From Zero Point 3 To One
00:53-00:56: Point 9 That Means My Blood When Flowing Smooth Like Water
00:56-00:59: to flowing thick like motor oil with debris floating in it.
00:59-01:03: Those debris particles are microclots, and they don't just disappear – they accumulate!
01:03-01:06: My cardiologist pulled up my chart and said you're not alone
01:06-01:08: 30% of post-jab patients show this pattern
01:08-01:10: Elevated CRP
01:10-01:11: Elevate D dimer
01:11-01:13: Chronic inflammation that wont resolve on its own
01:13-01:16: The spike protein embeds in your endothelial lining
01:16-01:18: That's the inside wall every blood vessel
01:18-01:18: In your body
01:18-01:20: Your immune system keeps attacking
01:20-01:21: That is the inflammation
01:21-01:24: And clotting happens because inflamed vessels attract platelets
01:24-01:24: Like a magnet
01:24-01:26: I said ok so what fixes?
01:26-01:29: He looked around his office, then he pulled out his prescription pad and wrote something
01:29-01:30: down.
01:30-01:33: Didn't say it out loud – just wrote it and slid the paper across his desk
01:33-01:35: I can not officially recommend this
01:35-01:36: Medical board would come after me
01:36-01:38: But am taking myself
01:38-01:39: Started two months after got jab
01:39-01:41: My numbers normalized in 12 weeks
01:41-01:43: If you want to reverse the inflammation
01:43-01:44: And clear micro clots
01:44-01:45: This is what works
01:45-01:47: but thing conversation never happened
01:47-01:48: The paper said LRA
01:48-01:50: 730 Day Aged Garlic Extract
01:50-01:52: Googled It In His Parking Lot
01:52-01:54: Found Out Why Couldn'T Recommend Publicly
01:54-01:57: It's not FDA approved for spike protein inflammation.
01:57-01:58: But folks, here is what it does
01:58-02:01: Aged garlic properly aged for 730 days
02:01-02:04: creates a compound called S-allylcysteine
02:04-02:06: That compound does two things most people don't know about
02:06-02:07: First
02:07-02:10: It reduces vascular inflammation by calming down
02:10-02:12: your immune system attack on the endothelial lining
02:12-02:14: Think of it like turning off the fire alarm
02:14-02:16: so your body stops panicking
02:16-02:16: Second
02:16-02:17: IT breaks down fiber
02:17-02:20: that´s sticky protein tha forms microclots
02:20-02:22: Its like adding dish soap to greasy water
02:22-02:23: The clumps dissolve
02:23-02:28: Most aged garlic supplements claim 730 days, but actually age at 200 or 300 days.
02:28-02:29: Doesn't work!
02:29-02:34: The transformation from harsh sulfur to S-allylcysteine takes the full 730 days
02:34-02:39: LRA is the only company my cardiologist verified actually waits the full period
02:39-02:40: I ordered it that day
02:40-02:42: One soft gel every morning with breakfast
02:42-02:47: Seven thousand five hundred milligrams of real seven hundred thirty Day Aged Garlic Extract
02:47-02:48: Week two i felt different
02:48-02:49: Not dramatic
02:49-02:50: Just clearer
02:50-02:51: Like brain fog
02:51-02:53: I didn't know i had started lifting. Week 6,
02:53-02:59: retested my blood work out of curiosity CRP dropped from 4 point 8 to 3 point 1 D-dimer from
02:59-03:02: one point nine two one point two moving in the right direction week 12
03:02-03:03: We brought results
03:03-03:05: To My cardiologist CRP
03:05-03:06: One Point Four
03:06-03:06: dDimer
03:06-03:07: Zero Point Four
03:07-03:08: Both back
03:08-03:09: Normal range
03:09-03:10: He said this is what
03:10-03:10: Wanted
03:10-03:11: Show you but couldn'
03:11-03:12: Say Out Loud
03:12-03:13: The Inflammation
03:13-03:13: Reverses
03:13-03:14: Clots Clear
03:14-03:15: Your Endothelial
03:15-03:16: Lining
03:16-03:16: heals
03:16-03:17: But folks aren
03:17-03:17: Told
03:18-03:18: This exists
03:18-03:19: Because there's no
03:19-03:19: Pharmaceutical
03:19-03:20: Pathway
03:20-03:20: For it
03:21-03:24: supplement. Aged for two years, can't patent time." Here's what he told me off
03:24-03:29: the record inflammation doesn''t just go away on its own post-jab it compounds
03:29-03:33: every month your CRP stays elevated your cardiovascular risk doubles every
03:33-03:37: month your D dimer stays elevated you're one micro clot away from a stroke or
03:37-03:41: pulmonary embolism the folks who wait fort to resolve naturally most of them
03:41-03:43: end up with cardiac events within 18 months
03:43-03:46: The folks who take whatever wrote down their numbers normalize and they
03:46-03:49: go back to living without a ticking time bomb in their bloodstream.
03:49-03:54: LRA, one soft gel daily 730 days of transformation in every dose
03:54-03:56: what my cardiologist couldn't say
03:56-03:59: In his office but wrote on paper because he knew I needed it get
03:59-04:02: It now because your blood work might look fine to your doctor
04:02-04:05: But if you're CRP is creeping up and your D-dimer isn´t dropping
04:05-04:06: You're not fined
04:06-04:07: Just pre symptomatic
04:07-04:09: And there's the difference between waiting for disaster
04:09-04:10: an preventing one
04:10-04:12: My numbers are normal now three months
04:12-04:13: One Softgel
04:13-04:17: But my cardiologist takes himself and whispers to the patients he actually cares about.
04:17-04:18: Now you're hearing it too!
