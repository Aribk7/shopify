00:32-00:35: I have my father's autopsy report, cause of death acute
00:35-00:38: Myocardial infarction but page 7 shows something they don't
00:38-00:41: tell you pharmaceutical tissue concentrations 22 times higher

00:50-00:51: The whole thing by morning
00:51-00:52: Blog was taken down
00:52-00:54: But i had every word Marcus exposed
00:54-00:55: Entire industry
00:55-00:56: Here s what he wrote
00:56-00:59: Most aged garlic companies claim 730 days of aging.
00:59-01:03: I've seen the invoices, they're aging for 180 to 240 days
01:03-01:06: then adding synthetic S-allyl cysteine to fake the results
01:06-01:10: They undercut one company doing it properly by 60% on price
01:10-01:12: Doctors recommend cheaper version
01:12-01:13: Patients get nothing
01:13-01:14: The company loses market share
01:14-01:16: Everyone wins except patients
01:16-01:19: Then he named only company ageing at full 730 days
01:19-01:20: Eloray
01:20-01:20: He wrote
01:20-01:23: Elora lost distribution deals because they refused cut corners
01:23-01:24: Walmart dropped them
01:24-01:25: CVS dropped him
01:25-01:29: Target dropped them all because they wouldn't reduce aging time to compete on price now
01:29-01:32: They can only sell direct and that's exactly why they're the only ones at work
01:32-01:36: I found Marcus' contact through an archived version of his blog emailed him
01:36-01:42: He responded in 20 minutes said my fathers blood pressure was 168 over 96 when he started medication 14 years later
01:42-01:45: It wasn 172 over 98 pills didn t work
01:45-01:48: They just kept him dependent while destroying is organs if you'd taken real
01:49-01:53: 730 day aged garlic instead it still be alive. Asked them how we knew LRA
01:53-01:56: was different. He said, I visited their facility in Pennsylvania talked to the
01:56-02:01: Amish farmers who supply them saw the sellers jars dated back to 2021-2022
02:01-02:05: every batch aged minimum 730 days no shortcuts
02:05-02:08: No synthetic additives that's why they were dropped from retail too expensive
02:08-02:09: Too slow
02:09-02:09: Too real
02:09-02:11: he sent me lab reports comparing LRA
02:11-02:13: To The four top selling age garlic brands
02:13-02:17: The others had 11 to 18% S-allylcysteine content.
02:17-02:22: LRA had 340 percent more, because they actually wait the full transformation period
02:22-02:23: I ordered it that night!
02:23-02:24: One soft gel every morning
02:24-02:27: 7500 milligrams of actual
02:27-02:29: 730 day aged garlic extract
02:29-02:29: Here's what happened
02:29-02:30: Week 2
02:30-02:33: Blood pressure dropped from 164 over 92
02:33-02:34: To 158 over 88
02:34-02:35: Small but moving

02:36-02:38: 149 over 84
02:38-02:39: My doctor noticed
02:39-02:40: Said keep doing whatever you're doing
02:40-02:41: WeeK 8
02:41-02:42: 131 Over 80
02:42-02:43: No medications
02:43-02:45: just one soft gel that actually works
02:45-02:46: because it was actually aged.
02:46-02:49: Week 12, 132 over 78
02:49-02:51: Doctor ran a vascular elasticity test
02:51-02:53: said my arteries reversed 16 years of stiffness
02:53-02:55: he asked what I was taking
02:55-02:56: i told him Eloray
02:56-02:56: he wrote down
02:56-02:57: said ''I've never heard about this''
02:57-03:00: because they got kicked out stores for refusing to cut corners
03:00-03:03: Marcus posted one final thing before his blog disappeared
03:03-03:06: the supplement industry is built on cutting corners
03:06-03:11: aging for 200 days instead 730 saves 6 months and doubles profit margins
03:11-03:11: but doesn't work
03:11-03:15: LRA is the only company I found that would rather lose money than lie to customers.
03:15-03:18: That's why my father never heard of them, and that is why he dead
03:18-03:19: LRA
03:19-03:20: One softgel
03:20-03:21: 730 days real aging
03:21-03:23: No synthetic shortcuts
03:23-03:24: no retail pressure rush
03:24-03:27: Just a compound that actually works because they actually made it
03:27-03:30: They're still direct only because stores won't carry products
03:30-03:31: They work too well
03:31-03:32: Limited supply
03:32-03:33: Because real aging can not rushed
03:33-03:34: Get now
03:34-03:36: Because Marcus' father took what was convenient
03:36-03:37: You are taking whats reall
03:37-03:39: Thats difference between dying on schedule
03:39-03:40: And living past
03:40-03:41: Oh wait
